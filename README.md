## Section 1: Data Pipelines

An e-commerce company requires that users sign up for a membership on their website in order to purchase products from the platform. As a data engineer under this company, you are required to design and implement a product pipeline to process the membership applications submitted by users. Applications are batched into a varying number of datasets and dropped into a folder on an **hourly** basis. You can use any common scheduling tools (e.g. cron, Airflow) to implement the scheduling component.
 
In this pipeline, you are required to ingest, clean, perform validity checks, and create membership IDs for successful applicants. Applications are considered successful if:
- mobile number is 8 digits (excluding country code)
- applicant is over 18 years old as of application year (i.e. 2023)
- applicant has a valid email (i.e. email ends with @emailprovider.com or @emailprovider.net)

You are required to format processed datasets with the following constraints:
- Provide `first_name` and `last_name` columns
- Remove any rows which do not contain a name field. You are to treat this as unsuccessful applications.
- Provide a `date_of_birth` column with the format **YYYYMMDD**
- Create a new field `above_18` based on the applicant's birthday. Applications that don't fulfil the age criteria should be treated as unsuccessful applications. 
- Membership IDs for successful applications should be automatically generated by the system. They are generated as a concatenation of the following fields **only**:
  - The applicant's `last_name`, followed by 
  - a `SHA_256` hash of his/her `date_of_birth`, **truncated to the first 5 digits of the hash** 

    *Note: The membership ID of an applicant should be in this format:*
    ```
    <last_name>_<hash(date_of_birth)[:5]>
    ```

Additionally, the team requires additional design considerations to the pipeline. Such considerations are:
- Overall summary notification after each processing job. The summary should be generated as a single `string` object, 
minimally containing the following details:
  ```
  - Number of rows processed
  - Number of successful applications, including the name of the file generated
  - Number of unsuccessful applications, including the name of the file generated
  - (*and any other data quality metrics that you may deem necessary*)
  ```


You are required to **process the input data provided in this repository** (`dataset1.csv`, `dataset2.csv`, and `dataset3.csv`). Output datasets should be easily identified and organised for general downstream workloads. **Include description of a test planto ensure robustness of your design**

**Please provide the scripts created, and the output data after processing. Ensure that respective files and directories are
included to enable easier replication for assessment purposes.**

## Section 2: Databases 
**NOTE: There are 2 options in this section. Attempt only 1 option!**

### Option 1

You are appointed by the applications team in an e-commerce company to create a database infrastructure for their sales transactions. Purchases are being made by members of the e-commerce company on their website. A member can purchase any number of products within a single transaction.

The following are known for each product listed for sale on the e-commerce website:
- Item Name
- Manufacturer Name
- Cost
- Weight (in kg)

Each transaction made by a member should minimally contain the following information:
- Membership ID
- Item(s) bought
- Date of transaction

i) Draw an entity-relationship diagram to represent the data models required to fulfill the above requirements. **Please submit your design in an image format (e.g. `.jpg`/`.png`)**

ii) You are also tasked to build and deploy your design in i). Set up your database using PostgreSQL with the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) provided. **You are required to submit the DDL statements for the tables, and the necessary scripts to deploy the Docker image (minimally a Dockerfile)**.

iii) Additionally, you are requested to justify your database design by providing the relevant SQL queries to satisfy some of their requirements. Some of these requirements include:
- Get the total cost of item(s) purchased by a member in a transaction
- A manufacturer rebranding resulted in a change of the manufacturer's name only

**Please submit the queries for use to satisfy the above scenarios.**

### Option 2

You are tasked to design and create the database system required for analytical use cases. Your users are asked to generate reports that provide a statistical overview of HDB towns in Singapore. The datasets (available on data.gov.sg) required by users are:
- [List of Resale Flat Prices](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/189/view)
- [Median Rent by Town and Flay Type](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/156/view)
- [HDB Property Information](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/150/view)
- [List of Licensed Supermarkets](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/1565/view)
- [List of PHPCs under National COVID-19 Vaccine Program](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/501/view)

Some of the use cases the users are required to report on can be:
- What are the cheapest and most convenient towns to purchase a resale flat? 
- What are the cheapest and most convenient towns to rent a flat?
    - Convenience is defined by the number of available supermarkets, hawker centers, and clinics
- Which towns should be prioritised in building new hawker centers, supermarkets, and clinics?


**Note**:
For convenience of testing, the following constraints are given:
- Date range can be from January 2022 to December 2022 (inclusive)
- For questions towards time factors, the column {remaining_lease} can be disregarded. We will only look at the lease by year.


i) Draw an entity-relationship diagram to represent the data models required to fulfill the above requirements. **Please submit your design in an image format (e.g. `.jpg`/`.png`)**

ii) You are also tasked to build and deploy your design in i). Set up your database using PostgreSQL with the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) provided. **You are required to submit the DDL statements for the tables, and the necessary scripts to deploy the Docker image (minimally a Dockerfile)**.

iii) **Please submit the relevant SQL queries to fulfill the use cases listed above.**

## Section 3: System Design

You are given the role of the `Tech Lead` of a project for a company whose main business is in processing sensor data and ground surveys. 
This project aims to redesign and shift all of its existing on-premise infrastructure onto the cloud. 
Prepare a presentation to your technical project team on how you plan to design the data 
infrastructure on the cloud provider of your choice.

The company receives data from multiple sources. There are 2 data sources of data:

1. Sensor data from external sites deliver data to the company via the use of data streams. 
The stream application is hosted by the company. *Assume there are only 
1-2 sensor sites pushing data to Kafka consumer(s) in the application.*

2. There are surveyors tasked to manually upload survey data on a regular basis. They would upload data to the system 
via API through a web application hosted by the company.

As the technical lead for the engineering project within the company, you are required to design the system architecture
depicting the end-to-end flow of every pipeline on the cloud. 
The architecture should **minimally** address the requirements/concerns below:


- Code has already been written by the company's software engineers to process the data. 
This code also has to be migrated and hosted on the cloud. 

- For archival purposes, **any data** (raw and processed) has to be stored in the cloud environment for 60 days, 
after which it has to be purged from the environment for compliance and privacy. 

- The cloud environment should also host a Business Intelligence resource where the company's analysts can access and 
perform analytical computation on the data stored.

- To ensure that the system is robust, the team would require components that enable effective monitoring, 
and ease of deployment for engineers.

You are required to produce a system architecture diagram (e.g. `Visio`, `Powerpoint`, `draw.io`) for the above. 
You may use any of the cloud providers (e.g. `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`) to host your environment. 
Do indicate any assumptions made, and provide detailed explanations to your design considerations.

## Section 4: What is Data Engineering?

You are tasked to help an agency consolidate data and reduce data de-duplication over a 3 months period. You will prepare a presentation to executive leadership to influence them to sponsor this data engineering initiative.

Your use-case can be any business function that you are familiar with. You should consider the different perspectives of the stakeholders. Do include a definition of the use case as well as be prepared to dive deep in technical considerations.
Choose one of the following topics and prepare the presentation in relation to the scenario above:

1. What is Data Engineering?
2. Explain the value of using any Data Engineering concepts or technology needed to the solve data duplication.
3. What is a Data Warehouse?

This is a brief 5 minute face to face presentation. The audience includes senior managers, including directors from technical and non-technical backgrounds.

**Management is interested to hear how data engineering can be utilised to resolve the problem statement above.** Please exercise your own judgement to make any reasonable assumptions and submit the powerpoint presentation.
