## Submission Guidelines

Please create a Github repository containing your submission and send us an email containing a link to the repository.

Dos:

- Frequent commits
- Descriptive commit messages
- Clear documentation
- Comments in your code

Donts:

- Only one commit containing all the files
- Submitting a zip file
- Sparse or absent documentation
- Code which is hard to read

## Section 1: Data Pipelines

The objective of this section is to design and implement a solution to process a data file on a regular interval (e.g. daily). Assume that there are 2 data files `dataset1.csv` and `dataset2.csv`, design a solution to process these files, along with the scheduling component. The expected output of the processing task is a CSV file including a header containing the field names.

You can use common scheduling solutions such as `cron` or `airflow` to implement the scheduling component. You may assume that the data file will be available at 1am everyday. Please provide documentation (a markdown file will help) to explain your solution.

Processing tasks:

- Split the `name` field into `first_name`, and `last_name`
- Remove any zeros prepended to the `price` field
- Delete any rows which do not have a `name`
- Create a new field named `above_100`, which is `true` if the price is strictly greater than 100

_Note: please submit the processed dataset too._

## Section 2: Databases

### Option 1

You are appointed by the applications team in an e-commerce company to create a database infrastructure for their sales transactions. Purchases are being made by members of the e-commerce company on their website. A member can purchase any number of products within a single transaction.

The following are known for each product listed for sale on the e-commerce website:
- Item Name
- Manufacturer Name
- Cost
- Weight (in kg)

Each transaction made by a member should minimally contain the following information:
- Membership ID
- Item(s) bought
- Date of transaction

i) Draw an entity-relationship diagram to represent the data models required to fulfill the above requirements. **Please submit your design in an image format (e.g. `.jpg`/`.png`)**

ii) You are also tasked to build and deploy your design in i). Set up your database using PostgreSQL with the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) provided. **You are required to submit the DDL statements for the tables, and the necessary scripts to deploy the Docker image (minimally a Dockerfile)**.

iii) Additionally, you are requested to justify your database design by providing the relevant SQL queries to satisfy some of their requirements. You are provided the following sample scenarios:
- Get the total cost of item(s) purchased by a member in a transaction
- A manufacturer rebranding resulted in a change of the manufacturer's name only

**Please submit the queries for use to satisfy the above scenarios.**

### Option 2

You are tasked to design and create the database system required for analytical use cases. Your users are asked to generate reports on HDB resale prices provided in [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices), to provide a statistical overview of housing prices in Singapore.

Some of the use cases the users are required to report on can be:
- What are the average resale prices of each flat type in each town?
- What are the top 10 towns that has resale flats with the oldest lease commence date (by year)

``` 
For convenience of testing, the following constraints are given:
- Date range can be from January 2022 to December 2022 (inclusive)
- For questions towards time factors, the column {remaining_lease} can be disregarded. We will only look at the lease by year.
```

i) Draw an entity-relationship diagram to represent the data models required to fulfill the above requirements. **Please submit your design in an image format (e.g. `.jpg`/`.png`)**

ii) You are also tasked to build and deploy your design in i). Set up your database using PostgreSQL with the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) provided. **You are required to submit the DDL statements for the tables, and the necessary scripts to deploy the Docker image (minimally a Dockerfile)**.

iii) **Please submit the relevant SQL queries to fulfill the use cases listed above.**

## Section 3: System Design

Prepare a presentation to your project team on how you plan to design data infrastructure on the cloud for a company whose main business is in processing images. Your role is the `Tech Lead` for this project.

The company has a web application which collects images uploaded by customers. The company also has a separate web application which provides a stream of images using a Kafka stream. The companyâ€™s software engineers have already some code written to process the images.

The company would like to save processed images for a minimum of **7 days for archival purposes**. Ideally, the company would also want to be able to have some Business Intelligence (BI) on key statistics including number and type of images processed, and by which customers.

Produce a system architecture diagram (e.g. Visio, Powerpoint) using any of the commercial cloud providers' ecosystem to explain your design. Please also indicate clearly if you have made any assumptions at any point.

Share about the `pros` and `cons` of your design to justify the decisions you have made.

## Section 4: Charts and APIs

Your team decided to design a dashboard to display the statistic of COVID19 cases. You are tasked to display one of the components of the dashboard which is to display a visualisation representation of number of COVID19 cases in Singapore over time.

Your team decided to use the public data from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#b07f97ba-24f4-4ebe-ad71-97fa35f3b683.

Display a graph to show the number cases in Singapore over time using the APIs from https://covid19api.com/.

_Note: please submit screenshots of the dashboard_

## Section 5: Machine Learning

Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

- Maintenance = High
- Number of doors = 4
- Lug Boot Size = Big
- Safety = High
- Class Value = Good

## Section 6: What is Data Engineering?

You are tasked to help an agency to consolidate data to reduce data silos over a 3 months period. You will prepare a presentation to executive leadership to influence them to sponsor this data engineering initiative.

Your use-case can be any business function that you are familiar with. You should consider the different perspectives of the stakeholders. Do include a definition of the use case as well as be prepared to dive deep in technical considerations.
Choose one of the following topics and prepare the presentation in relation to the scenario above:

1. What is Data Engineering?
2. Explain the value of using any Data Engineering concepts or technology needed to the solve data silos.
3. What is a Data Warehouse?

This is a 5 minute face to face presentation. The audience includes senior managers, including directors from technical as well as non-technical backgrounds.

Management is interested to hear what can be done with data engineering to solve the problem described above. Please exercise your own judgement to make any reasonable assumptions and submit the powerpoint presentation.
