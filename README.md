## Submission Guidelines

Please create a Github repository containing your submission and send us an email containing a link to the repository.

Dos:

- Frequent commits
- Descriptive commit messages
- Clear documentation
- Comments in your code

Donts:

- Only one commit containing all the files
- Submitting a zip file
- Sparse or absent documentation
- Code which is hard to read

## Section 1: Data Pipelines

The objective of this section is to design and implement a solution to process a data file on a regular interval (e.g. daily). Assume that there are 2 data files `dataset1.csv` and `dataset2.csv`, design a solution to process these files, along with the scheduling component. The expected output of the processing task is a CSV file including a header containing the field names.

You can use common scheduling solutions such as `cron` or `airflow` to implement the scheduling component. You may assume that the data file will be available at 1am everyday. Please provide documentation (a markdown file will help) to explain your solution.

Processing tasks:

- Split the `name` field into `first_name`, and `last_name`
- Remove any zeros prepended to the `price` field
- Delete any rows which do not have a `name`
- Create a new field named `above_100`, which is `true` if the price is strictly greater than 100

_Note: please submit the processed dataset too._

## Section 2: Databases

You are appointed by a car dealership to create their database infrastructure. There is only one store. In each business day, cars are being sold by a team of salespersons. Each transaction would contain information on the date and time of transaction, customer transacted with, and the car that was sold.

The following are known:

- Each car can only be sold by one salesperson.
- There are multiple manufacturersâ€™ cars sold.
- Each car has the following characteristics:
- Manufacturer
- Model name
- Serial number
- Weight
- Price

Each sale transaction contains the following information:

- Customer Name
- Customer Phone
- Salesperson
- Characteristics of car sold

Set up a PostgreSQL database using the base `docker` image [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) given the above. We expect at least a `Dockerfile` which will stand up your database with the DDL statements to create the necessary tables. Produce entity-relationship diagrams as necessary to illustrate your design.

Your team also needs you to query some information from the database that you have designed. Note that the business requirements for the database is **not limited** to the 2 queries below, do design your database to account a wide range of business use cases. You are tasked to write a `sql` statement for each of the following task:

1. I want to know the list of our customers and their spending.

2. I want to find out the top 3 car manufacturers that customers bought by sales (quantity) and the sales number for it in the current month.

## Section 3: System Design

You are given the role of the `Tech Lead` of a project for a company whose main business is in processing sensor data and ground surveys. 
This project aims to redesign and shift its existing on-premise infrastructure onto the cloud. 
Prepare a presentation to your technical project team on how you plan to design the data 
infrastructure on the cloud provider of your choice.

The company receives data from multiple sources. There are 2 data sources of data:

1. Sensor data from external sites deliver data to the company via the use of data streams. 
The stream application are hosted by the company. *For convenience of this assessment, assume there are only 
1-2 sensor sites pushing data to Kafka consumer(s) in the application.*

2. There are surveyors tasked to manually upload survey data on a regular basis. They would upload data to the system 
via API through a web application hosted by the company.

As the technical lead for the engineering project within the company, you are required to design the system architecture
depicting the end-to-end flow of every pipeline on the cloud. 
The architecture should **minimally** address the requirements/concerns below:

- Code has already been written by the company's software engineers to process the data. 
This code also has to be migrated and hosted on the cloud. 

- For archival purposes, **any data** (raw and processed) has to be stored in the cloud environment for 60 days, 
after which it has to be purged from the environment for compliance and privacy. 

- The cloud environment should also host a Business Intelligence resource where the company's analysts can access and 
perform analytical computation on the data stored.

- To ensure that the system is robust, the team would require components that enable effective monitoring, 
and ease of deployment for engineers.

You are required to produce a system architecture diagram (e.g. `Visio`, `Powerpoint`, `draw.io`) for the above. 
You may use any of the cloud providers (e.g. `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`) to host your environment. 
Do indicate any assumptions made, and provide detailed explanations to your design considerations.

## Section 4: Charts and APIs

Your team decided to design a dashboard to display the statistic of COVID19 cases. You are tasked to display one of the components of the dashboard which is to display a visualisation representation of number of COVID19 cases in Singapore over time.

Your team decided to use the public data from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#b07f97ba-24f4-4ebe-ad71-97fa35f3b683.

Display a graph to show the number cases in Singapore over time using the APIs from https://covid19api.com/.

_Note: please submit screenshots of the dashboard_

## Section 5: Machine Learning

Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

- Maintenance = High
- Number of doors = 4
- Lug Boot Size = Big
- Safety = High
- Class Value = Good

## Section 6: What is Data Engineering?

You are tasked to help an agency to consolidate data to reduce data silos over a 3 months period. You will prepare a presentation to executive leadership to influence them to sponsor this data engineering initiative.

Your use-case can be any business function that you are familiar with. You should consider the different perspectives of the stakeholders. Do include a definition of the use case as well as be prepared to dive deep in technical considerations.
Choose one of the following topics and prepare the presentation in relation to the scenario above:

1. What is Data Engineering?
2. Explain the value of using any Data Engineering concepts or technology needed to the solve data silos.
3. What is a Data Warehouse?

This is a 5 minute face to face presentation. The audience includes senior managers, including directors from technical as well as non-technical backgrounds.

Management is interested to hear what can be done with data engineering to solve the problem described above. Please exercise your own judgement to make any reasonable assumptions and submit the powerpoint presentation.
